**useHills** | **Double** | A measure of willingness to take tackle hills. Values near 0 attempt to avoid hills and steeper grades even if it means a longer route, and values near 1 indicates that the rider does not fear them. Note that as some routes may be impossible without hills, 0 does not guarantee avoidance of them. | [optional] [default to 0.5]
