## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes

**attribution** | **String** | A URL containing attribution information. If you are not using Stadia Maps and our standard attribution already for your basemaps, you must include this attribution link somewhere in your website/app. | [optional] 
**query** | **[String: AnyCodable]** | Technical details of the query. This is most useful for debugging during development. See the full example for the list of properties; these should be self-explanatory, so we don&#39;t enumerate them in the spec. | [optional] 
**warnings** | **[String]** | An array of non-critical warnings. This is normally for informational/debugging purposes and not a serious problem. | [optional] 
**errors** | **[String]** | An array of more serious errors (for example, omitting a required parameter). Donâ€™t ignore these. | [optional]
